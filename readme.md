# Text generation using deep learning and LSTM

Please read the associated [blog post](https://hdmetor.github.io/generate-text-with-deep-learning/) for more information on how it works.

In short is a characther-wise network consisting of two 512-dim LSTM.

Note that for the scrip to work, there must be a `text.json` file in the folder.

Please refer to [this project](https://github.com/hdmetor/HNCrawler) to download the text.
